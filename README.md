**Step 1:**

Target- to reach 99.4% accuracy within 10 epochs without regularization

Get the set-up right
Set Transforms
Set Data Loader
Set Basic Working Code
Set Basic Training & Test Loop

Results:

Parameters: 6.3M
Best Training Accuracy: 99.79
Best Test Accuracy: 99.13

Analysis: 
Extremely heavy model with large number of parameters
Overfitting


**Step 2:**

Target: 
Get the basic skeleton right. 
Reduce the parameters to reach the target of 20k within 10 epochs
Reach the model accuracy at 99.4% without regularization

Results:
Parameters: 194,884
Best Training Accuracy: 98.88
Best Test Accuracy: 98.72

Analysis: 
Model is still large with lesser than target accuracy. 
Very slight overfitting. Train and Test accuracy is pretty close in the 10th epoch (tr=98.88, test=98.72)
